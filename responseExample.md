description: "Parsnips, popular with ancient Greeks and Romans, were brought over to the Americas with the first colonists. Although parsnips are biennials, they are usually grown as an annual vegetable. Parsnips are a hardy, cool-season crop that is best harvested after a hard frost. Parsnips are not only tasty in soups and stews, but can also be enjoyed by themselves."

feeding: "Always keep the beds free of weeds."
growing_from_seed: "Sow 2 seeds per inch ½ an inch deep. Seedlings will emerge in 2-3 weeks."
